Gaining personal intuition on Repositories
Hello All,
My name is Daniel. Since its highly probable I will be the only one who looks at this, I will write this for my future self. Hello, Daniel from the future. I am/was currently sitting on the first floor of the University Center learning how to use Github. It is/was a foggy morning and I am/was over looking the Lagoon. I forgot my water bottle at home and had to purchase a water cup whihc costed me 10 cents. Thank goodness Daniel from the past that bought that side of ranch for fifty cents and saved the change until this moment when I forgot my water bottle. Daniel from the past was thinking out for me right now amd will probably put a smile on your face, Daniel from the future. Cheers to the infinite selfs.
